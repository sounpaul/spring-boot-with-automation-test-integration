#Serenity BDD Integration for Functional Testing
Serenity BDD helps you write cleaner and more maintainable automated acceptance and regression tests faster. 
Serenity also uses the test results to produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe what your application does and how it works. 
Serenity tells you not only what tests have been executed, but more importantly, what requirements have been tested.

##Command to execute the Serenity BDD Tests
````
--> gradle clean bddTest or ./gradlew clean bddTest for running all the tests

To run any specific tag
gradle clean bddTest -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@AddEmployee"
gradle clean bddTest -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@DeleteEmployee"
gradle clean bddTest -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@UpdateEmployee"
gradle clean bddTest -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@GetEmployee"

#Gatling Integration for Performance/Stress Testing
Gatling is designed for continuous load testing and integrates with your development pipeline. 
Gatling includes a web recorder and colorful reports. Gatlingâ€™s code-like scripting enables you to easily maintain your testing scenarios and seamlessly automate them in your continuous delivery pipeline.

##Command to execute the Gatling Performance Simulation
````
--> gradle clean gatlingRun -Denvironment=dev or ./gradlew clean gatlingRun -Denvironment=dev
To run for a default load of 1 TPS for 1 second

To run customized load
